# 🛡️ Cyber Warfare Intrusion Detection System

### Detecting, Analyzing, and Preventing Cyber Attacks Using Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Cyber Warfare Intrusion Detection System** is a cybersecurity project designed to detect **malicious activities and cyber attacks** within a network.  
Using **machine learning algorithms**, the system classifies network traffic as **normal or intrusive**, helping to identify cyber warfare threats such as **DDoS attacks, probing, malware, and unauthorized access**.

This project demonstrates real-world applications of **Cyber Security, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
* 🔍 **Detect** cyber intrusions in network traffic  
* 🧠 **Apply** machine learning for attack classification  
* 📊 **Analyze** patterns in network data  
* 🚨 **Identify** cyber warfare threats early  
* 🛡️ **Improve** network security and reliability  

---

## ⚙️ Features
* ✔️ Network traffic monitoring  
* ✔️ Intrusion detection (Normal vs Attack)  
* ✔️ Multi-attack classification  
* ✔️ Machine learning–based prediction  
* ✔️ Data preprocessing & feature extraction  
* ✔️ Graphical visualization of results

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow



1.  **Dataset Collection:** Gathering raw network traffic logs (e.g., NSL-KDD or UNSW-NB15).  
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical data.  
3.  **Feature Selection & Scaling:** Identifying key indicators of attacks and normalizing data.  
4.  **Model Training:** Training various supervised learning algorithms.  
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Testing using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
6.  **Intrusion Prediction:** Real-time classification of incoming traffic.

## 🧪 Algorithms Used
* **Logistic Regression:** For baseline binary classification.
* **Decision Tree:** For capturing non-linear relationships.
* **Random Forest:** To improve accuracy through ensemble learning.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** For high-dimensional data separation.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** For pattern-based proximity classification.
